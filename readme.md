## Overview
This browser extension aims to enhance your YouTube browsing experience by hiding shorts and suggested videos. It injects CSS scripts to achieve this functionality.

## How it Works
The extension utilizes CSS scripts to hide shorts and suggested videos while you browse YouTube. By injecting these scripts into the YouTube page, it modifies the layout to exclude unwanted elements, providing a cleaner viewing experience.

## Requirements
To utilize this extension, you'll need a browser that supports the [`:has`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has) CSS selector. Specifically, Chrome/Edge version 105 or above, Firefox version 121 or above, and Opera version 91 or above are required due to their support for this selector.

## Installation and Usage
1. Install the extension in your compatible browser.
2. Once installed, the extension will automatically start working whenever you browse YouTube.
3. Enjoy a clutter-free YouTube experience without shorts and suggested videos.
